I have a bachelor's degree in Information Management, have been working as a Sommelier for the past 3 years and have been in the Hospitality industry for over 15 years.
                            My passions inlude Food, Wine and Sport. I am a bubbly, competitive, hard worker. I am a quick
                            learner and am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve and learn. I enjoy creating, establishing
                            and maintaining business and customer relationships and strive to excel at this. My hospitality and customer
                            service background has stemmed into a strong mental aptitude for working efficiently under pressure, and
                            creative problem solving on the job.

                            me new skills. I have plenty of Customer Service, Supervisory, Management, Event and Operational experience
                            and would love to work in a challenging environment. </p>
